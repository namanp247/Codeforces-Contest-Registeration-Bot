:muscle: I wrote a Python script that automates my gym time bookings at midnight everyday.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, gyms in Ontario have implemented an online sign-up system that requires members to book for a specific workout time.  
The gym I go to allow members to start booking their gym times at midnight everyday, which is an inconvenient time for me.  
So, I decided to create a bot that does it for me.

### Tools/Technologies: ###  
* [Selenium WebDriver](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/en/webdriver/)  
* [Amazon EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/)

### How I built it: ###  
:arrow_right:	I web scraped my gym's website by inspecting its **HTML** elements.  
:arrow_right:	I used [**Selenium**](https://www.selenium.dev/) to automate the booking process, more specifically, 
I used [**ChromeDriver**](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/) which is a standalone server that is used by [Selenium WebDriver](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/en/webdriver/) to control tests on Chrome.  
:arrow_right:	I set up an [**AWS EC2**](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) instance that runs the script on the cloud.  
:arrow_right:	I installed [**Putty**](https://www.putty.org/) to allow me to connect to the instance.  
:arrow_right:	I scheduled a [**cron job**](https://www.hostgator.com/help/article/what-are-cron-jobs) that automatically runs the script at a specified time in my [**AWS EC2**](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) instance.

### To use: ###  
:arrow_right:	Clone this repo and set up your local copy of the repository.  
:arrow_right:	Download [**ChromeDriver**](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/) so you can run the automated script on Chrome.  
:arrow_right:	To create, launch, and connect to an [**AWS EC2**](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) instance, follow this useful guide [here](https://praneeth-kandula.medium.com/launching-and-connecting-to-an-aws-ec2-instance-6678f660bbe6)  
:arrow_right:	If you do not wish to run the script on the cloud, you can set up a task scheduler (Windows only) and it will run the script only if your machine is turned on

#### Now you can get your gym booking while being sound asleep! ####
